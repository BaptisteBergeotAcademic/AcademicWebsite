	abstract = {Simple models of clarinet instruments based on iterated maps have been used in the past to successfully estimate the threshold of oscillation of this instrument as a function of a constant blowing pressure. However, when the blow- ing pressure gradually increases through time, the oscilla- tions appear at a much higher value than what is predicted in the static case. This is known as bifurcation delay, a phenomenon studied in [1] for a clarinet model. In numerical simulations the bifurcation delay showed a strong sensitivity to numerical precision. This paper presents an analytical estimation of the bifurcation delay of the simplified clarinet model taking into account the numerical precision of the computer. The model is then shown to correctly predict the bifurcation delay in numerical simulations.},

@inproceedings{Bergeot2014a,
	abstract = {Simple models of clarinet instruments based on iterated maps have been used in the past to successfully estimate the threshold of oscillation of this instrument as a function of a constant blowing pressure. However, when the blowing pressure gradually increases through time, the oscillations appear at a much higher value, called dynamic oscillation threshold, than what is predicted in the static case. This is known as bifurcation delay, a phenomenon studied in [1, 2] for a clarinet model. In particular the dynamic oscillation threshold is predicted analytically when the blowing pressure is linearly increased. However, the mouth pressure cannot grow indefinitely. During a note attack, after an increasing phase, the musician stabilizes the mouth pressure. In the present work, the analytical prediction of the dynamic oscillation threshold is extended to a situations in which the mouth pressure approaches a steady state pressure according to an exponential time profile. The predictions still show a good agreement with simulation of the simple clarinet-model. This situation is compared in terms of dynamic oscillation bifurcation.},
